# Naiara Lopes â€” Developer Portfolio

Hi! I'm Naiara Lopes, a civil-engineer-turned-developer with a passion for building beautiful, functional web experiences.

This is my personal portfolio built with **Next.js 14**, **Tailwind CSS**, and way too much caffeine. It showcases my projects, skills, and the chaotic journey from blueprint math to JavaScript magic.
